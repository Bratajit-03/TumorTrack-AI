# TumorTrack AI

TumorTrack AI is a Transfer Learning based Brain Tumor Classification system capable of predicting type of brain tumor using MRI images.It is trained using Inception V3 architecture and has acquired an accuracy of 93.69% on the training dataset and 80.20% on the validation dataset.

# How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Run the Application**: Run the Streamlit application using the following command:
    ```
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3. **Upload MRI Images**: Once the application is running, upload an MRI image of the brain using the file uploader.

4. **View Results**: The application will process the uploaded image and display the predicted result indicating the type of tumor detected.
